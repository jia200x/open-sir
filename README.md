# open-sir

Open-SIR is an Open Source Python project for modeling pandemics and infectious diseases using Compartmental Models, such as the widely used [Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model](http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/corona/docs/forecast/model/#classic-sir-dynamics). 

The current stage of the software is *Alpha*.

## Features
- Model the behavior of infectious diseases
- Parameter fitting
- Calculation of confidence intervals
- CLI for interfacing with non Python environments (Bash, Node.JS, Matlab, etc).

So far, Open-SIR provides an implementation of the SIR model and the recently new SIR based model SIR-X, developed by the [Robert Koch Institut](http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/corona/docs/forecast/model/#sir-x-dynamics-outbreaks-with-temporally-increasing-interventions).

## Getting Started

Open-SIR uses [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to automatically create a virtual environment and manage python packages. The python packages required by Open-SIR are listed in the [Pipfile](Pipfile).

### Prerequisites

Python 3.7 and Pipenv are required. 

```
Pipenv
Python 3.7
```

And the python packages
```
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
jupyter
sklearn
```

### Installing

After cloning the repository, change the current directory to the repository by `cd open-sir` and automatically install the environment from the Pipfile using Pipenv:

```
pipenv install
```

Next, activate the Pypenv shell:
```
pipenv shell
```

Check that the installation was succesful using:

```

```
